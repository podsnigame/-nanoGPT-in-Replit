He intended to be king of England, and to govern in the royal house. The Prince of Wales, with a more sober and eloquent character than our older, was appointed to govern the kingdom.\n\nThe Prince of York had been in the highest position of the kingdom, and was with him that most noble and noble monarch, and most noble princes and princes of this land, till his death.\n\nThis Prince was to be a king and a queen of Northumberland, and be the queen of England, of Ireland; and by his marriage with the new queen, he would become a crown prince of England, and most of her subjects, who would not be without some of the rights which it was lawful to confer upon themselves; and he would rule Northumberland."]]}
