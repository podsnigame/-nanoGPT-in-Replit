 To be or not to be. The notion of doing something is easy to sustain for so long as you don't lose grip on it. The second problem with this approach is that it really doesn't tell you what you should do. It's hard to know what to do when you're not feeling it 100%.
Instead of worrying about whether what you're doing is right or wrong and whether it's actually wrong, don't worry about how bad it is. It's better to call up a friend or a coworker or a colleague who's trying to say something that's absolutely correct. You know more what to do about it when it's really wrong.
4. Don't give up hope
This one's a bit more obvious. I'm not sure if I'm saying all the time that I'm still talking to myself about what I was doing wrong. This is, however, a really basic aspect of doing a good job of being self-aware about your own health and well-being.
For a long time I was just telling myself that if I could live with the fact that I was suffering, I would be happier. And for a long time, I'd be more happy without it. But now I'm thinking of telling myself it's the right thing to do, and that it's time to do something about it. I've heard people say these things to me and things are doing better, but this is just a prelude to doing a better job of holding on to it.
The best advice I've ever received from people who have actually been doing this job was this: Don't give up hope. Be honest with yourself. Even though you might have a better attitude about yourself that you're doing well with, you need to be willing to admit you've been wrong.
Don't be afraid to admit that you've been wrong. You've been wrong about yourself. Be proud to say that you have been wrong about yourself.

5. Ditch guilt
This one's a bit more complicated. First…
I'm convinced that in a few decades, the world will be a better place. There will be a time when we all realize that our lives are more rewarding in some way. It might be more stressful than it was in the past. It might even be quite awful. We might even be better off today. But until then, there will be times when

2. There are two categories of alcohol consumption by people who may or may not have consumed alcohol:
a. Those who use drugs to "buy" or "sell" drugs.
b. Those who don't use drugs to "buy" or "sell" drugs.
c. Those who have drunk alcohol and consumed alcohol that is believed to be or was determined to be "comfortable" or "safe."
d. Those who have not been otherwise able to consume alcohol.
e. Those who have been "disordered" (I) or "disordered" (II) or (III).
f. Those who have been "confused or confused" (I) or (II).
g. Those who do not eat or drink.
h. Those who are able to eat or drink "too much" or "drunk too much."
For example, a 17-year-old has a problem with alcohol and suffers from seizures over alcohol consumption. He is unable to swallow and cannot take a cigarette for the next 10 days, only once every 20 hours.
For example, if he is an 18-year-old, he is not able to swallow the next 20 liters of beer.
For example, the 9-year-old is unable to swallow a six-litre bottle of milk.
While this list of alcohol-related problems may be confusing, it does not mean that drinking alcohol is one of them.
2.1 Alcoholics are the most common group of people not to consume alcohol.
1. A person who drinks alcohol is not capable of consuming alcohol as a result of the actions that they take to "get drunk."
2. There are two categories of alcohol consumption by people who may or may not have consumed alcohol:
a. Those who use drugs to "buy" or "sell" drugs
b. Those who don't use drugs to "buy" or "sell" drugs
c. Those who have drunk alcohol and consumed alcohol that is believed to be or was determined to be "comfortable" or "safe."
d. Those who have not been otherwise able to consume alcohol.
e. Those who have been "disordered" (I) or (II) or (III).

* And she did not have the heart of a man.
* And she did not know that he was righteous.
* And she did not know that he was blameless.
* And she did not understand that he was a thief.
* And she did not know that he was a viper.
* And she did not know that he was an ark-bearer.
* And she did not know that he was an ark-horseman.
* And she did not understand that he was a demon.
All this, for the sake of the world, does not hinder her from feeling in a religious sense. She stands before the throne where she will not be judged and judged as she pleased; she lays her hand on the throne and smote the head of her servant, and she does not look at him, but looks at her only. And she will say to him, "When will Myself be judged?" And that is what she will say to him.
As I shall write, she will indeed feel the law for herself; she will not like to be judged or punished. But she will not worship as an idol, unless she be able to repent and to go on to reach the kingdom of the Lord. But there will be signs in her eyes that will help her to repent of her sins. So too, I shall say before this book shall become a book unto her, through the deeds of those who have done her the wrong. And then she will be judged:
For She will not be judged just because she had done wrong with them.
For she will have received the punishment she was destined to, only because she did wrong with them. And when she had done wrong with them, not only did she be punished for her wrong, but she was punished for transgressions.
Do not give her the wrong stuff, but justify her wrong with the right things.
Do not beat her and bewitch her; for it is better to be loved than to be shunned, than to hang your head on a pile of ashes and be a sheep.
They shall punish you, she shall punish you, and she shall punish you with the wrath of Hell.
Do not beat her and bewitch her, but justify her wrong with her.
Do not beat her and bewitch her,

I like this.
I want to understand.
No, my prince, no, no, no, no, no.
O, no.
No, no, no, no;
No thing!
I don't have a new command.
I suppose I won't be doing a quarter-hundred thousand pounds a year.
Sixteen years, or eight hundred eight.
That's a fortune, but it's a very good one.
I must be told, to a million and a half pounds a year.

Do you understand?
I have no idea how you get your money;
My children are poor, and they do not care to know what I am doing.
When my children are poor,
For I know you are rich.
When my children are poor,
I know you are rich, but not so rich.
Then they are poor.
But all that I do is what I do.
And that's where your money is?
I don't care.
I don't care, sir;
I'll never live in my money.
I'll never be in yours.
Leave me.
You can't help me.
I don't care, sir.
You're too much rich.
Give me money,
For you'll never live well.
O, oh, dear,
I'd rather die than be in your pew.
No, sir;
I'd rather die than live.
I like to die.
Where then are you going now?
I hope you'll come, sir.
How shall we go?
The time is about to come when you are to go.

But God took a look

And he found the truth, and was glad

No man has tried to say that he was ever unfaithful,
except by false promise,
In his heart.
I'm going to deny this assertion,

To him who is the enemy of the world,
who is the man who enchants his way,
with his thoughts and his desires,
says the Lord:
To him who has the power, who has his clothes,
which is a God who gives him life,
who is the King in Heaven;
who is the King through whom all will see
their works.'

I shall not tell how he could have made this up,
but I will show his nature;
to him who has the power, who has his garments,
who is the King of Death;
who is the Lord through whom all will see
their works.'

I know the matter well:
To him who has the power,

All the world knows, for what power shall he use against me?
The word of the Lord means, 'I have no power.'
If I have the power, I shall be vanquished.
Make no vain effort: for if you are possessed,
you shall utterly destroy me.

(At this time we were talking about the council meeting, and there was a report of the king of France, that he was no longer present; it was of his heart. Therefore he did not send the messenger, but sent two ambassadors, both from Ephraim and the king of France.)
(Our conversation was interrupted by the king of France, who was with us, and he also went into the chapel, and before going off he told the council of the king of France: to give the oath is to him to make them answer our questions before we come to hear of him; otherwise the prayer and the signs of the prayer would be useless, and I would not have my faith. Then asked who was present with him, and he replied: that he spoke to us, saying that he had already received the king's letter, but that he did not answer it, and that the rest of the time had been only heard of him from his own people.)
This we took in writing, and he swore it to us, and when we had received him, we took it and buried it in our own tomb, and we then spent the night with him in vain.
CHAPTER XXIX.
The God of England.--
Then came we to a certain house, and there was a man of great bravery and power who had served his master for so long.
As he stood there and passed the wall. He was not to know the place, as yet, but stood very close to the entrance, and said:
"I hope you will tell me a little by day, and then, when I am dead, will I die again; and when I am good, I will be gone. I do not go on living that I am a man."
At this he said:
"I hope you shall tell me more by the time I am dead."
Do you enjoy your life, dear king?
He answered:
"There is no need to know, for we all know that your life is a matter of life, and I am told by your master that you are in such a state, and that he knows that you are dead

Then said he:

The next day came, the friar's wife made him make a lie before him; and as they were in that way, he spoke, saying:

The friar's wife, I say, laid a large bundle of lidded corn and boiled the ground without my consent. Then, I tell you, he made a lie before me, saying:
'My lord, look not thyself; for it is not in thy hand.'
Then said he:
'My lord, look not thyself; for it is not in mine hand.'
So he did, and as he spoke, he made a lie before him before him before the ground.

 To be or not to be: it is not necessary to make change; but to be moved by change which forms one and the same.
Whence do you say:
The fact is, that all these things are right, and that they are, so long as they are at liberty, or will be, and to the end:
This is the truth of this matter of the truth of the matter.
But would you be so bold, and so obstinate, when you said,
I ought to have made this change my deed, and to have made this change my deed, so that I might have done it for my own ends;
I would not have made my deed my deed, but I would have done it for my own purposes;
As I have done it, so now, you would have done me wrong.
How, then, do you, I wonder, how could I have done it for the benefit of these poor persons, whom we, as anciently acquainted, have been robbed of our freedom, our liberty, our happiness, and our common good,
And now this poor creature, who speaks!
Do you, then, know, therefore what I am to do, when I am gone?
If I am gone, then, therefore, I am gone:
Is not it at one time, if I am gone, that I cease to be an animal,
And to stand so ably, that as I am now dead,
And as I am now dead, I am a human, and not a duke?
How?
Why, it is not at their death, in the state of youth,
That man, who is no froward, is in the state of youth,
That hath bred a man, to be so feeble as a man hath bred a dog.
Suppose, then, that man had bred two dogs, but one of them were a dog; and that therefore I by my deed, I did not do it, not for my own sake, but for the sake of your own and mine own.
I am therefore guilty: My deed, then, is, to be done; for, by this deed, I make one change, and make another change:
And as I made one change, so I made another change,
And so, now, now, tell me, how all

 To be or not to be: an example of a fine and wise man; a mark of a well-bred goodman; for his goodness and goodness of heart.
GRAMMAR: Sir, what is the nature of the matter?
WARREN:
Well, it is a matter of good and bad, of many things. In my life, though I may at some time or another make a good judgment, a very great part of the matter is not my good.
GRAMMAR: But I am like a man of his time?
WARREN:
Nay, I am such a man.
GRAMMAR:
Do you not think, Sir, that you have knowledge of things, like great ages, and great people? And if not, what is the science of mankind?
WARREN:
I know nothing of it.
GRAMMAR: How about you?
WARREN:
I am glad.
GRAMMAR:
O, O, I'll tell you.
WARREN:
And you, Captain, you have gone to war, sir, for three months, seventeen of which you were in the militia.
GRAMMAR:
What, Captain, which battles you are in?
WARREN:
I am glad to have been in your service; but it seems to me that you now lack the memory of war.
GOTHAM:
Indeed, sir, I am glad of that.
WARREN:
The greater part of the good do suffer; and the lesser part, much less much; but the great part is the good.
GRAMMAR:
We know hardly one man by whom I am well; but what of your conduct?
WARREN:
I am, sir, in an amiable cause: a cause in which it may be hoped that a good man will be more happy than another.
GRAMMAR:
What is the cause of such a love?
WARREN:
I say that it is not to be, but I do not know or understand it.
I may say, sir; but if it is, I shall know it.
GRAMMAR:
What do you think of any wars which do feel violence to some?
WARREN:
I think they are

No! his hand is still bound to his body;
No wonder: the whole of his head is lost,
He must never be called.

KING ISABELLA:
What did you say when you spoke of the young man,
He stands by life?
TURNER: I did say he stands by life,
And that would indeed be a good thing.
KING ISABELLA:
Say how much better for him than those I did?
TURNER: Why, he stands by life,
His eyes open, he smiles, he keeps his face shut.
KING EMBARRO:
What, then, did you say when you, sir?
TURNER:
My God, I am so glad, like a child, to be dead.
KING EMBARRO:
What, then, did you say when you were dead,
That you would have to kill him,
That you would not, sir?
TURNER:
My God, I am not so much dead as I am dead.
KING EMBARRO:
What, then, did you say when you were dead?
TURNER:
I am dead.
KING EMBARRO:
How do you know?
TURNER:
I have been dead; I have been dead.
KING EMBARRO:
What, then, did you say when God came?
TURNER:
He began to speak this, on the first day of August;
As if to say, 'Ah! come to the children,
When we have the children, we will be born to you;
And if your wife gives you money and no more so,
And she does not your mother's will, you cannot help but be gone.
KING EMBARRO:
How do you know that?
TURNER:
I shall use him; I shall use you, sir.
KING EMBARRO:
Then tell me, sir, what deed
Did you do that day?
TURNER:
I had a good meal with my wife,
And what was

WOLFORD RICHARDSON:
The noble prince, that your grace, your glory,
And your life, your freedom,
And your inheritance, shall make you a king,
And, I hope, a prince of your majesty
A prince that will not do you any wrong;

 To be or not to be;
The sun hath far set
A mystery to find,
A shadow that cannot be proved. For, unspeakable is the truth,
As one you heard to the wind's hearth:
And all the heavens are dimmed:
Yet the sun is coming down, and yet not hearing,
And are weary.
LUCIO:
What do you mean, 'twere
Prayer for men, and no for women -
A man might say 'hail'
Or 'twere, and yet he
Is not heard:
Or more than once.
GLORIUS:
The sun hath seen you, and yet
Not seen you;
So can't you have 'twere?
Therefore,
I'll ask you:
For, behold, in one month,
The sun hath gone down:
And yet it towered to you:
Then towered all night, I'll pray you,
And night to dawn to dawn;
Come, and I'll tell you a story:
For, whose mother
Hath lived with you not but two?
LUCIO:
Her daughter, my dear, my daughter;
She went away, and in the high air
Than to you and stood a little.
This was my common mother's love.
GLORIUS:
Now, now, a little as it is,
The sun's light is to be heard;
And the hour of my death
Is near, and yet no more.
LUCIO:
Nay, nay, it is in your name.
GLORIUS:
O, you too are here with me. I'll tell you,
If you will not tell me, I'll go out with me;
And if you will, I'll return to Rome
and tell you 'twere.'
GLORIUS:
O, my gracious brother,
I'll give you my heart: I'll not bear you to death.
Pray!'
O, thou dost trust me,
Thou hast not the will:
You'll tell me your heart, and my heart is
Folio's face; and will I believe it?

The word is 'love' (I'll tell you what it is,

For in truth I am alone.

Oh, and my name is John, a true man?

How did I not know? whence you came?
Where did you come;
Have you here?

My father's marriage, by which we became cousins,
And Edward's father's brother,

Have you not thought that the words 'our common consent'
Have been common?

I do not think so, sir.
BY JOHN THOMAS:
Or why the words 'common consent'
Are so common?

I do not think so.

Because all consent and no reason,
What things but common consent should I be,
Or the more common 'it shall be' and 'by common consent'?

And I shall never be lord of the earth.

You will, but I will not be lord.

 To be or not to be! For none of those is to be.
The Lord Almighty never said: Whatsoever you shall or h'dleth, do it.
So, it is as if the Lord Almighty said:
QUEEN:
With an iron tongue
In flesh mine own.
BY JOHN MARSHALL
In this book, I shall show you that as the words in the matter,
What language am I to speak;
When the Lord Almighty heard
that I speak, he that the Lord took
the offence, that he did it,
And so, being a wrong tongue,
I speak what I shall speak to the Lord
And the rest, to the Lord himself,
And not me. For to be
more than
can be understood, can be understood
though made less; but henceforth
the word must be drawn from the body of
that which is, and from which is not;
For, I remember, the Lord will
speak
to his servants and servants' wives, and to all
his servants' wives.
It is said to me that these things were
the affairs of our time, to-morrow, and that he
has made them to be.
As I shall speak, I shall think you, and
will not trouble you.
And then thou shalt tell me what I shall
Speak of, and what I shall speak of.
The Lord Almighty never said: Whatsoever thou shalt
speak of, do it.
QUEEN:
And what thou shall say shall
be as I speak, and what thou shall say shall
be as I speak of.
BY JOHN MARSHALL
I have seen, and we shall all one another to hear
what is good and evil in your state;
But, therefore, be thou quietest about it:
For, with this knowledge, and with this understanding,
I'll be sure to find you good, and indeed
have made you good.
QUEEN:
God forbid, my Lord, any harm done to thee.
BY JOHN MARSHALL
Alas! God forbid.
QUEEN:
Lord! pray to God!
QUEEN:
Lord, if thou, with those words,
seem to speak a word to me,
I shall speak to thee

I was never so stupendous and ungrateful.

I am content to wear the garb and go on.

Of course I am. I am thou this.

 To be or not to be, which is, our good friend, is not to be: a man is not to be; but a statue which stands within his frame of life, a man is not: something that, from the external point of view, is not; yet not to be.

Your point is, to be the object of lawlessness.

How?

PRIEST:
Why?
LUCIO:
Some of the servants of the king, and some of his officers;
Many, many, many of those who have power,
The most eminent of them are to be slain; and in such a way are we slain.
PRIEST:
And of them?

Of all the dead, with their heads stuck to the ground.

And your body, the living thing still,
A body which still remains alive,
With his head hanging there on his body,
Clips all his limbs, and he is the man you left.

What is the meaning of his death?

I look upon his body as a flesh being,
For my body is that which is still alive.

Is still living in so many bodies!

I do not know for what purpose.
LEGENDARY:
Thus the laws of nature and the laws of nature
Are true, perfect, and constant.
True, perfect or imperfect.
To you and me, both
Each in his species, each in his way
And each in his nature, each in a way
As nature itself should be.

 To be or not to be:
He who's a tyrant and a wolf,
Or corrupt of all his lands:
As many as kings, as bequeathed
To his subjects, who came for his love.
KING HENRY VI OFRINIX:
Your majesty,
I beseech you, it is with you most
That I have set my hand
Against the so-called king.
KING HENRY VI OFRINIX:
What wish'd me there?
KING HENRY VI OFRINIX:
What has done me wrong?
KING HENRY VI OFRINIX:
Wherefore do I cause an accusation?
KING HENRY VI OFRINIX:
Ay, and henceforth, my lord,
There I stand, and do deliver a sentence.
KING HENRY VI OFRINIX:
Madam, go, and tell me the manner in which I am
Profound.
KING HENRY VI OFRINIX:
Oh, madam. I shall, as well do so;
To the king's courts, and his subjects;
And to the king's prisons, and his subjects;
To his subjects that have been taken, and that have been sentenced;
And to their masters and his subjects,
Which at any time might be released:
Now, my lord, I must not be sure
Which in this world is the most probable.
KING HENRY VI OFRINIX:
Madam, I would say, to every king;
That is what the king's court had in mind.
KING HENRY VI OFRINIX:
And we believe in the queen's integrity.
KING HENRY VI OFRINIX:
Madam, madam, she is one of the most honest;
And since she was brought to obedience
She is in a state of readiness, like a high maid;
And she may stand shameless, as one who is not like
An honest maid; but she is the soul of the queen.
KING HENRY VI OFRINIX:
Indeed; I pray you, madam, she is not.
KING HENRY VI OFRINIX:
Madam, madam! as you fear the queen,
Tell me whether

 To be or not to be;
Where the words are not pronounced
But in the tongue of a plain,
And whence they are written in this bold
To make a deep impression;
And if heaven were better, where are the men
That have been bred
To hold our tongues too long?
KING EDWARD III:
This is the way of our redemption;
Thou art that thou were the child of sorrow;
And thou art a devil that hath taken away
Our hope;
For none can save us from his sin.
KING EDWARD IV:
But if thou wilt repent,
If thou wilt be the child of sorrow,
God pardon thy soul;
For pardon is our redeemer's guilt;
If he is the guilty ghost of sorrow,
Then we shall neither more nor less.
KING EDWARD IV:
This is the way of our redemption;
Thou art that thou were the child of sorrow;
And thou art a devil that hath taken away
Our hope;
Therefore let us bear him not
The prison of the house of shame:
And let us bear him not our joys.
CLARENCE OF CUMBERLAND:
This is the way of our redemption;
Thou art that thou were the child of sorrow;
And thou art a devil that hath taken away
Our hope;
Therefore let us bear him not our joys.
KING EDWARD IV:
I beseech thee, then!
Therefore follow my counsel:
Therefore serve the princely grace;
I may wither it in the bosom of my soul
And sleep with it in my blood;
As thou art the shadow of sorrow.
CLARENCE OF CUMBERLAND:
When I call her, I swear I will never speak of her.
KING EDWARD IV:
Woe is me!
For, if thou art the shadow of sorrow,
Thou art a devil that hath taken away
Our hope;
Therefore let us bear him not our joys.
CLARENCE OF CUMBERLAND:
Gentlemen, I swear I have no power to lay any
Duty upon thee;
A truth in art which beggars comfort,
And which I am not to blush,
Upon thee, where I am in this most secret
Believer.

 To be or not to be, and to be
A true friend, but yet I have not been
To take every means to be myself
A true friend
Being an honest fellow: but I had
To have a frank face when I was in a

Fellow in a way, and I hated my
Brother more than I hated my brother
Against all common sense.

Not--

In respect for you I am not
Uncle that you have wronged me; I am
Uncle that you have wronged me.

And if I love you, why can I stop my
Adultery?
BRUIS:
No, though you have hurt me with your
Hate, but I have never given you any
Bad breath.

But, let me tell you, yours is an end
To him, and not to you:
You have done all of our business,
And I am fond of all of your
Hates; you have done all your business,
And I will perform your service.

Yes, I am fond of them; for I have
A friend in you, and may well expect him
To love me in himself.

For, as I shall say, I shall be born in England.
LUCIO:
O people who say that!
BILLINGHAM:
I'll tell you another's story!
LUCIO:
You have the same name, Julius Caesar:
Says Sicilius, 'tis true;
And what did you tell him?
BILLINGHAM:
He was no man of you;
He means yourself:
But he was one of the most depraved enemies of Rome.
LUCIO:
You mean himself?
BILLINGHAM:
Too proud was he,
And I mean mine first as well.
LUCIO:
What is it? sir?
BILLINGHAM:
That you say he was sent in order to have
Sicilia's brows about a prison.
LUCIO:
No, sir! what would you do?
BILLINGHAM:
If I was sent in order to have Sicilia's brows
About a prison.
LUCIO:
You'll be sent to Vienna.
BILLINGHAM:
If that:
I will not.
LUCIO:
Why not?
BILLINGHAM:
That you say it means 'no' in my eyes.
LUCIO:
I'll be so.
BILLINGHAM:
But of course I am not to be a prisoner,
Because it is my duty; nor shall my son
Make himself, nor shall he break his oath.
LUCIO:
Men, go, take your leave of me;
I'll speak your way.
BILLINGHAM:
I'll serve you, sir.
LUCIO:
Servant!
PRINCESS OF ROME:
Madam,
Good sir, your letter of resignation is the first
Whereupon I will come to Rome.
LUCIO:
You will, sir, take your leave of me.
PRINCESS OF ROME:
Sir, you shall not be dismissed.
LUCIO:
Nay, sir.
PRINCESS OF ROME:
Your brotherly brother, I would tell you now my name:
---------------
 To be or not to be
What I am to be, I shall not be
Nor shall I be a 'twere. 'Tis
That I keep at it.
KING RICHARD II:
I did make thee a prophecy,
That I shall tell thee what:
That if thou be true, thou wilt be
A true prince: the prince is not to be
But to be not, as Richard goes to school.
HENRY ILLUSTRIA:
I knew not how he, nor if he,
And never have I in my life
Turn'd me to the side of reason.
KING RICHARD II:
What can I say?
HENRY ILLUSTRIA:
My faith is well and true;
I know not how a prince will know
The truth of his deeds.
KING RICHARD II:
All I know of him is that he has no sons,
And the prince may in general be thus
Made to be a prince.
HENRY ILLUSTRIA:
Not so.
KING RICHARD II:
You shall not be born prince, queen,
Any more than a queen.
HENRY ILLUSTRIA:
What must be the purpose of all that thou hast born?
KING RICHARD II:
I do not know;
But thou art determined: for, as thou art a king,
You must be wise: nor do I.
HENRY ILLUSTRIA:
And then they shall not follow me;
Therefore for my mother's sake: I am the queen.
KING RICHARD II:
I know not; thou art the heir of heaven:
Thou shalt inherit mine throne;
And when thou shalt buy me my supper,
I shall take thee by my chappels.
HENRY ILLUSTRIA:
For it shall not be lawful to return I should
To this place.
KING RICHARD II:
Thy husband's death is an unlucky loss,
Having been a widow, and she, being with thee,
Did make thee a queen to be revenged.
HENRY ILLUSTRIA:
If he will not be so in such an office,
I will serve him.

 To be or not to be: wherefore, when thou wert a lie, thou wert a lie.
TRUMPER:
I am a lie.
THE PRESIDENT:
Tell me, sir, how do you do?
TRUMPER:
I come from a country where I have been paid sir, and have been paid a lie.
PARIS:
Sir, I do not know why you speak such a word.
TRUMPER:
I know that it is not my name. But, if you ask me, I will tell you what I do owe you.
PARIS:
Sir, if you do answer me, I will tell you what I have received for it, and why you do.
TRUMPER:
I do demand the truth, sir, and why you desire it.
PARIS:
Not so, but you will not desire it, Your Lordship.
TRUMPER:
No, you do not.
PARIS:
I do demand the truth, sir; and why you do so.
TRUMPER:
I cannot know your good name: I speak not
stereotypes, sir, that lie in the eyes of men.
PARIS:
Sir, I do not know you: I never did do this with my
life; and my purpose in life in this manner, I cannot
tell you, is to conceal myself in it.
PARIS:
I confess my name is noble, and I confess my dishonour.
TRUMPER:

tribunal's receipt,

 To be or not to be.
AMBUSH:
I'll come, sir.
JUDGMENT:
Is it a gentleman?
AMBUSH:
No; and yet I think I will, that God's approbation shall be heaven's love, and see every man's wife, or any woman, serve as good as her
presence; for I see it is in her grace that she reigns; so that grace may be what the world
stands with,
as well to the world's happiness as with God's grace.
JUDGMENT:
What, that's a gentleman?
AMBUSH:
I shall not have any wife but in the grace of heaven,
for I shall not put my law to a knee,
Nor put my law to a sword, nor keep my grace in a woman's face.
JUDGMENT:
You will not say 'I am a gentleman,' I do not say 'I am a gentleman.'
AMBUSH:
No:
Because none shall have a wife unless the good woman
shall be good.
JUDGMENT:
Do you mean that the world is happy with your grace, but that it is angry with your
justice?
AMBUSH:
I do not do so, sir.
JUDGMENT:
When I came to the world, I had a husband, by God,
that must not have a wife; while I never had a husband,
since my country was not my own;
who would answer me, Sir, as I do my wife, who
would the day we married, that God finds me happy?
I do seem to answer 'I am a gentleman,' sir;
even in the world's happiness, which God does not manage with,
due to my grace:
but I am a virtuous man, and he that makes me a husband
shall give me a wife, for I do do part of his services
in my life.
JUDGMENT:
You cannot say my grace is offended.
AMBUSH:
God hath no cause for this, sir, if you will dare.
JUDGMENT:
I beseech you, sir, not to make me happy.
AMBUSH:
Why, sir? because there is no

 To be or not to be:
As though there could be no body but one
Who was not sinless:
For to the one's body she is guilty;
But, as the sinless,
She is guilty, as the impure:
And, hence, as if there were no body but one
Who was not sinless;
For to the body she is guilty;
But, again, as though there were not one,
Who was not impure,
She is not guilty:
That is, as if she were a person;
For she is a person;
For she is a person; that is, not a mortal
But a creature, which is sinless.
BRUNO:
Then, my lords, if there is no subject, say which
The other, a mortal, says he is a body:
Now, my lords, are you the next person?
BLACKMUNDY:
I remain at your bedside.
BRUNO:
Wherefore, my lord?
BLACKMUNDY:
As I may say, I will sit at your bedside.
BRUNO:
My lord?
BLACKMUNDY:
As I may say, what is your body?
BRUNO:
Your body is your being alive; and
Your body is your being dead.
BRUNO:
My lord:
You cannot be alive unless both are dead;
Unless both have died together.
BRIAN:
Of course:
Why, my lord; but what is your soul?
BRUNO:
My soul is but a part of me;
Though no soul is alive.
BRIAN:
With a part of you living and living other parts dead?
BRUNO:
My soul is a part of me dead;
And a part of me alive; the rest dead;
As much as part thereof:
I will be but a part of this dead being
And a part of this dead being dead.
BRIAN:
What, my lord?
BRIAN:
I have an object here, my lord;
This is from a stone:
And I have a stone; and now you die,
And I am dead.

Which is why the present-day-day is so much like it.
KING RICHARD II:
Now, see, Buckingham: how 'twere, even now?
BRUCE VINCENTIO:
Not a little, sir; for you know how he is.
KING RICHARD II:
Now, must I go, and see him, sir?
BRUCE VINCENTIO:
O, to be or not to be; and we'll be very late.
KING RICHARD II:
Good morning, good chapeuse.
BRUCE VINCENTIO:
Merely to lie with him in this bed,
To bid to be a fool and to call me a foolish
boy!
KING RICHARD II:
Nay, an honourable man, one
of my own brother Henry's good kindhood,
A kinsman beside the gracious prince.
BRUCE VINCENTIO:
Yes, sir; good Henry, good Henry;
And your good love too, as well as mine,
And my goodness, not all that good Henry's;
Good Henry, gentle Henry, good Henry, good Henry!
KING RICHARD II:
Now, father, I must again speak, and say this:
I have a brother whose name is Edward.
BRUCE VINCENTIO:
His name is Edward.
KING RICHARD II:
Your gracious Prince, you must know your title,
Your name, your name, your character.
BRUCE VINCENTIO:
Alas, sir, my title's not Edward,
Nor Henry, nor both Edward and Richard.
KING RICHARD II:
Your honourable prince, your honourable honourable prince,
Your honourable honourable honourable prince!
BRUCE VINCENTIO:
Sir, it's not Edward, nor Richard, nor Edward,
Nor both my honourable prince and your honourable honourable
honourable prince:
This is their cousin, Edward.

Marry, Edward!

Whom I love,
What I hate,
I hate; I hate not.

The devil will think it
Sweet, sweet, and gentle.

Truly, with a heart like to weep
I'll weep, and yet have tears,
Most precious to my soul:
An angel weeping in the dark,
An angel weeping in the earth,
An angel weeping in those hearts!
And I'll weep; and yet have tears,
Most precious to my soul,
Most precious to my soul.

Bless this, pray my soul:
I'll weep; I will weep; I will weep; I will be weeping,
As if the air were cold.

Let my tears have their sweet air.

Good night, my poor child; good night, my home

How is this a son of an ancient Welshman,
How hast thou had this honour like a Welshman?
GRANT:
Uncle Claudio, he is not well thought of;
His presence marks the death of our beloved king.
GRANT:
These are my words:
I have heard, and in all the world
I have heard, that the youngest son of an old Welshman,
He would not die upon his father's death:
But he stands so far above the rest; he is of the good,
Though they may die in his blood.
GRANT:
I am sure, therefore, he stood in heaven and was known.
GRANT:
Why, and what did he do?
GRANT:
He was told the thing by the Duke of Clarence,
That he was in love with the Duke of Somerset,
And had not consent to marry
It, but love the Duke of Clarence.
GRANT:
No, I am to swear that Clarence was a Welshman:
And I have a good sense that I shall see him hereafter.
GRANT:
Now, father, I shall beg your pardon
And speak good words to him.
GRANT:
I am prepared, father; I have an earnest,
First-born son and a well-spoken wife.
GRANT:
How thou art so much a gentleman,
As thou standest not in love of me,
As thou hast young, yet yet is still dear to me
When thou hast a daughter.
GRANT:
Tell me, what, what, my daughter,
I pray thee, how this man stands?
GRANT:
O, I pray thee, what, there is, your daughter,
With whom thou hast been so merry a friend?
GRANT:
I am not young, and I am in no particular danger.
GRANT:
And, as thou hast said, there is, your daughter?
GRANT:
O, I pray thee, what, there is, my daughter?
GRANT:
I am at hand, sir; but I think I shall not have it.
GRANT:
I pray thee, here is my daughter's daughter,
Claudio, his wife and children;

As much as I would have them.
KING RICHARD II:
The king's grace must be much than his
Anointing him from death.
FLORIUS:
Lest, my lord, and I, with all my heart,
This are so. You are well in your service
This Duke of York, I so thank you.
GLOUCESTER:
I will, my lord, and bear you to this present
Oy, of the poor York which you bequeath,
In the hope that it will bear you some day to
Return.
KING RICHARD II:
I will make them answer to me.
FLORIUS:
Sir, leave the oaths to the queen.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Lord, my gracious lord, to heaven
Have I given a full reckoning to-morrow,
That she might to-morrow
Take the throne with me for good.
KING RICHARD II:
To my good welcome!
GLOUCESTER:
As he has it done at King Richard's coronation,
I did the same to him at the Grey
As I did my oaths to the queen:
As he's done to me by us, I make
Nothing of him.
KING RICHARD II:
O, by my grace, and I, I do not know
What may be in my way; and yet, I must
tell thee, my lord, that she hath in her
One more worthy heir-in-law, than I have.
GLOUCESTER:
Tell me, now, if your grace may be so
Cousin Grey as the Duke of York,
If I could believe, by aught that I do understand,
That the queen himself be so good as I suspect
That true'st should be said, that she was the
Godfather of the world, and he was so.
KING RICHARD II:
What say you, my lord?
Wherefore, my lord, lay
The liege so far high with that his death
Did bury me; and was so for that: but the king
Is ere he came, from whom I owe such
Intentions as will let him have them. I cannot tell

Tell me, what is the matter?
ROMEO:
God loves some.
GLORIUS:
What is the matter?
ROMEO:
That's for the bishop of Rome.
GLORIUS:
I have already inquired him of, your majesty.
ROMEO:
No, sir; but I can't be more sure.
GLORIUS:
That's for the bishop of Rome:
That's for the bishop of Rome;
And from whence comes the people?
ROMEO:
I am in Rome, sir, to see if we may find some
bishops and men of good repute; and we can't
be more certain than the other: so, perhaps,
by me, we may discover our enemies.
GLORIUS:
We must, sir.
ROMEO:
I will, sir, but not before it hath been determined.
GLORIUS:
How then?
ROMEO:
No sooner, sir.
GLORIUS:
He will come hither with those men whom we have
found to be their enemies: that, before we know him,
he wants you to do us good
by visiting and looking for him.
ROMEO:
I thank him for some good business.
GLORIUS:
He knows me.
ROMEO:
I will, sir; let him be thy prisoner.
GLORIUS:
But, sir, the queen is in that prison
that he did visit near us.
ROMEO:
This is not the prison to whom we seek.
GLORIUS:
The bedside?
ROMEO:
The bedside.
GLORIUS:
I see, sir.
ROMEO:
I see:
Here is my prisoner, we are near
and I beg your pardon.
GLORIUS:
He is not your prisoner: but is there a place
for him there?
ROMEO:
I have heard of his; and in my mind, I
have determined to make him my prisoner.

That is the prison you are with; and you must go
there.

Whether he be now or not, and my lord,
Sir John, I will, in a few minutes, let him rest.
KING HENRY VI:
O, gracious lords!
What news will you tell me?
BUCKINGHAM:
I'll tell you.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Rescue him, what news will I tell you?
KING HENRY VI:
I'll tell you, sir, that he hath received his fair pardon.
This news came from, and I can come to you.
PRINCE HENRY EDWARD IV:
Thou art the king's cousin, and thy royal dignity.
KING HENRY VI:
What news do thou, sir, report?
BUCKINGHAM:
I know not--
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Then, sir, I will send to the court
a certain report of what's done in Bohemia.
PRINCE HENRY EDWARD IV:
To whom do you report?
BUCKINGHAM:
To the king; to the king's wife; to the king's children.
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Were you brought to Bohemia, thou art the king's cousin,
and thy royal dignity?
PRINCE HENRY EDWARD IV:
No, sir, no, lord; not even to the king.

Thou art his cousin, and

 To be or not to be:
This noble man, be thou so bold as to take your faith with me,
And from your life and your fortunes, make thy brother
A brave friend of mine:
A noble king, that God hath known,
That gave you so many honours,
And so many thanks, that we may all with all
Acquire your grace and your peace;
For thou wilt not be so poor as to sit upon his throne.
KING RICHARD III:
We beseech thee, holy brother, to be patient.
CLIFFORD:
O, thou wilt be so patient as to do him fair.
KING RICHARD III:
No mercy, my king, for I would have thee
The more bold than he, and to the world more severe.
CLIFFORD:
O, thou wilt, my Lord, never let thy sovereign stand
KING RICHARD III:
I am my lord of Norfolk. I am the Duke of Norfolk.
CLIFFORD:
Ay, my lord, I do not fear much with him.
You have a right to fear me?
KING RICHARD III:
Fear nothing, my lord; for he shall not be a king.
CLIFFORD:
Ay, my lord, I fear his usurperhood.
KING RICHARD III:
What, my lord, he is so cruel and tyrannical a tyrant;
Which is a more cruel and tyrannical tyrant
Nay, more tyrannical tyrant of his own.
CLIFFORD:
Ay, my lord, he is a worse tyrant of his own.
KING RICHARD III:
Ay, my lord, he is a worse tyrant of his own.
CLIFFORD:
Ay, my lord, he is a worse tyrant of his own.

Ay, my lord, he is a worse tyrant of his own.

 To be or not to be, or and like the chief thing in them, I will become dull, and ungainst.
PRINCE ROSSENBERG:
Then, Lord, bear your thoughts for a thing as good as they
are; and at the end of your life you will never
blond again.
BUCKINGHAM:
They will come, and he will speak, and then you will be a gentleman;
you shall have good friends, and you shall see good deeds;
but you will remember the things that have not been done.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
That's a privilege, sir, but not a privilege,
Commendation.
PRINCE ROSSENBERG:
Sir, if you would, sir, speak to a gentleman; and I
would you bring him up and answer you.
BUCKINGHAM:
But our trusty lord, hath gone to bed, and is,
By the grace of God, asleep.
BUCKINGHAM:
Your lordship and my lord,
There is not a man in our service, but he lies
out in the field; he cannot breathe.
PRINCE ROSSENBERG:
But hear me, my lord, to your lordship now:
And, my lord, to your lordship:
For, my lord, please, I am going;
I will not be idle.
BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, please, you are not idle;
And think you were here as well: for,
I know my lordship and your lordship
are gone; but I am gone, and I cannot be leisure
with you.
PRINCE ROSSENBERG:
You are not the 'twill be, your lordship?
What, my lord?
BUCKINGHAM:
No; and what, my lord?
PRINCE ROSSENBERG:
No: I came from your lordship, as you said
I am gone, though you are gone; and yet I am going,
In order that you may hear your lordship.
BUCKINGHAM:
I have come from your lordship, sir; yet I am gone.
PRINCE ROSSENBERG:

VOLUMNIA:
Then I trust, my brother, that no man shall ever be so unsullied.
CAPULET:
Wise words will make you wince,
And thou shalt no longer have life.
VOLUMNIA:
How then he that begins your life
Is so much fond as a man: that he cannot breathe it?
CAPULET:
My friends: he'll save his tongue
To sit on your breast.
VOLUMNIA:
Then look ye on the day: I'll take you,
And cheer you to a walk of humility
Where, in paradise, no man might dream that he did
Once with such a man.
CAPULET:
To be or not to be.
VOLUMNIA:
But be not, thou art not so, thou art not so.
CAPULET:
I thank thee, my lord.
VOLUMNIA:
That thou art so, my lord, is much better
Than thou art such a better man.
VOLUMNIA:
His gentle uncle's fair face!
CAPULET:
Thou art so gentle, my lord.
VOLUMNIA:
Nay, thou art so gentle, my lord.
CAPULET:
Thou art so gentle, my lord.
VOLUMNIA:
So gentle on his cheeks!
CAPULET:
I will say better, my lord.
VOLUMNIA:
But, my lord, is he so gentle?
CAPULET:
No.
VOLUMNIA:
My lord, is he so gentle?
CAPULET:
My lord, my lord.
VOLUMNIA:
My lord, my lord.
CAPULET:
Then how are you?
VOLUMNIA:
I have no time for long: I shall go home,
To my home,
And have a rest; and I am sorry, my lord,
For I cannot give my poor little boy
The comfort of his royal bed.
CAPULET:
Then how are you?
VOLUMNIA:
I am so comforted by the peace

 To be or not to be: it shall be a question.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Do you deny, sir?
I am a noble and an honourable man,
And yet, to think a thing is a lie and to speak it
Untruthful to my worth, nor to my honour.
QUEEN MARGARET:
I have not but the common knowledge to say
That a man should be free to do what he would not wish to
Speak it.
GLOUCESTER:
I think it is some good reason to think so.
QUEEN MARGARET:
The gentleman
Is most aching for it.
GLOUCESTER:
The gentleman is most certain
That from the very thing which I speak is false.
QUEEN MARGARET:
What's wrong with him?
GLOUCESTER:
He will not be able to do what he would like.
QUEEN MARGARET:
What is wrong with him?
GLOUCESTER:
I have thought it as if he would, or at least
Abe
A man who could make it.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Then how comes it, sir?
GLOUCESTER:
Because he cannot say so; he in fact cannot say so.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Well, sir, it was a necessity--
GLOUCESTER:
Hence it was a necessity at that time.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Then what is the nature of this necessity?
GLOUCESTER:
To say there is no necessity, nor manly manliness,
Pursued to call such a necessity.
QUEEN MARGARET:
If you did speak thus, that from your mind
I could perform this work, I'd do it no more:
This is true, Sir.
GLOUCESTER:
As I speak, I have grown much a man
Of deep affections, and have made him into a
Andalite; a traitor to all the good things I
Have done.

 To be or not to be, what is to be or not? Who is to be or not? This question is one of the most common in the business of life:
GLOUCESTER:
A man is to be or not to be, and if he be not to be, he whose purpose is the act of being,
He whose purpose is the act of being, or not. What, then, is he?
GLOUCESTER:
Either man or woman, if this is the case, then
Let him be, if he be not, and if he be not, let him be.
But if any one say,
'You are in love' and 'you are not,' let us answer 'You are not 'Both are in love.'
GLOUCESTER:
How then, then, may you be?
GLOUCESTER:
It is the great question.
GLOUCESTER:
Why, then, and then; how then, and then!
GLOUCESTER:
What, then, are you in love?
GLOUCESTER:
If you have one, and therefore say you are in love, be it so;
Or, if you have one, and therefore say you are in love, be it so;
If you have one, and therefore say you are in love, be it so;
Or, if you have one, and therefore say you are not in love, be it so;
Unless you are in love, and therefore say you are not in love.
GLOUCESTER:
If, and therefore say you are in love, have you but one?
GLOUCESTER:
To be or not to be; if he be,
And that, and that, are such things as are not.
GLOUCESTER:
If is not such, and this do you know,
This is a very great thing.
GLOUCESTER:
If, and therefore, if you do not know,
This is an excellent thing.
GLOUCESTER:
You must, and therefore, by this proceed to understand.
GLOUCESTER:
How then?
GLOUCESTER:
You must, and therefore, by this proceed to understand

GROWINGHAM:
Lash, but wash, and do not,
I'll go in; for I'll go away.
KING RICHARD III:
Your majesty, what news? If you depart,
In the ships and arms, I'll send an ambassador
There, and, if thou hast your heart, let him go.
CORIOLANUS:
I will it.
KING RICHARD III:
Hath he gone, he'll not see me, nor take it.
CORIOLANUS:
My lord, let him go.
KING RICHARD III:
Well, if he let no messenger go,
I'll send him away.
CORIOLANUS:
I'll send him away.
KING RICHARD III:
Sir, 'tis so, for it's not my time.
CORIOLANUS:
Ha! a man! what's the matter?
KING RICHARD III:
Pray, sir.
CORIOLANUS:
Sir, do you mean a messenger?
KING RICHARD III:
A messenger, sir, and is in command.
CORIOLANUS:
Ay, ay, sir.
KING RICHARD III:
To the Emperor, and to them both.
CORIOLANUS:
Hath he gone, he'll not see me, nor take it.?

My lord, do you mean a messenger?

A messenger, sir.
CORIOLANUS:
A messenger, sir.
KING RICHARD III:
Ay, ay, sir.
CORIOLANUS:
The head of the whole fleet,
And all the soldiers and casks,
And all the regiments,
And all the air-crafts and all their posts
Made the field of service; and the house-maids
Took charge, their heads and all, and broke down
Noble men's houses, and broke down the temples,
And all their faces shook with their broken

GLOUCESTER:
Ere this I must, I beseech Rome:
Let them be kind to her: let them be not kind to her.

I am your king, my lord.

I am your king, my lord
And as much your brother as it is my sovereign.

Of what?
BRUTUS:
As I am your sovereign.
ROMEO:
And as you are your king, my lord,
As you are your brother, my lord,
As you and I have the best of the world in common,
And all together with your brother,
Such an object for which you must think you owe
Your brother your brother, like to you, now be yours.
GLOUCESTER:
Sir, take yourself to me.
ROMEO:
If I might, sir, marry you the younger,
And live to see the time when your brother shall at last
Be yours; and a year hence, when our brother shall live,
I trust you'll find him dead, and die at your brother's request.
But, if you live to see that you have never married him,
Why, I will not tell you why.

Anon, I will not, sir. I am all for marriage.

I have no need of it.

My brother is my lord.

I be so glad, I say.

By my heart's blood, I'll do it 'ere for thee.

What, so that I may, what a man I must, to myself?
ROMEO:
I must be made an officer of the senate.

I'll call it my honour, sir, and no less my daughter.

I will not, God forbid, to death.

Poor morrow, poor lad, I will be a soldier.

I will be a double soldier, sir,
as I was a double before you; and be a knight.
CAPULET:
Sir, since you are more than the man, why, how can you be so as a soldier?
ROMEO:
In this way, sir, I am but a soldier.
CAPULET:
Is it true, sir? I have never fought;
No, sir; but when I had a father,
I was his grandfather.

I do think it not the part of his youth that he fought.
CAPULET:
My grandfather fought at a very rough time,
at the war's end, when he did bear his brother's death.

Thou forgot thy father's death; but, being so bold,
I should have fought with him.

CAPULET:
A woman, thou art a piece of a woman.
QUEEN MARCIUS:
Ay, but no; you must not look for love in any man;
And if you do, you are a piece of a woman, as I show you my son.
CAPULET:
I have borne him more, and that means I love more.
QUEEN MARCIUS:
Why take away from this a piece of a man?
CAPULET:
You must not look for love in any man.
QUEEN MARCIUS:
Ay, I do!

A piece of women: that is love to a woman.

Ay, know that, say I love you more than I love thee.

A woman, I say.

Ay, I have grown better than you.
CAPULET:
No, I have nothing.

No, no, no: I love you more than I have love.
QUEEN MARCIUS:
A man, what is it that thou art to do, sir?

And if so, then I would say, thou art self-sufficient.

 To be or not to be. This is the name of the man that is, and so hath he taught us.

JULIET:
'Tis well, you know, for you know much more than this.'
NORTHUMBERLAND:
'Tis well, I think, for I have heard the general; and know not whether the general hath heard the general.'
JULIET:
Who shall answer to you?
NORTHUMBERLAND:
My brother; and that of your brother have you been both the new
Forbs.
JULIET:
My brother, I shall be the first: I am the first of the new characters:
I am the first of the old characters; and must soon be the second.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
'Tis well, my brother. I will answer you: I have not been to you;
been to you in the past; you have come in my time.
How, 'twere not your time, my brother. I have not been in my time;
but I have come in the past.
JULIET:
I have been, my Lord; and though I have lived awhile,
I have borne no part in your time: for ever, my brother,
I was not my days
To pass twenty winters, nor ten days; thou, and I,
And I, were not my days: for ever, my brother,
I am my old days, and I, and thou, and thou, and I,

TRANSLATOR:
So, sir, is the meaning to be.
BRUTUS:
I'll tell you this: you two,
And I, from one occasion to another,
Were too close to you to speak for you,
To be or not to be, to be or not to be.
And yet, at the same time
You were too bold to be, to be or not to be,
To be or not to be, to be or not to be.
MADFIELD:
O, sir, I am not bold enough to speak for
You. But, my lord, he cannot speak for you,
No more, I defy your desire, nor your truth.
BRUTUS:
I do not know.
MADFIELD:
Why, have you done wrong to me?
BRUTUS:
Because you are too loud, too quiet, too bold,
Too young, too brave, too bold, too bold,
Too far from your being.
And yet, to speak for you, the sooner they hear
Your word, the sooner you speak for them.
BRUTUS:
Fair, good Lord.
MADFIELD:
And yet, for to speak for you, they heard you speak
Your word.
BRUTUS:
True, but they thought you spoke for them.
MADFIELD:
They thought they heard you speak
Your word.
BRUTUS:
True, but they thought you spoke for them.
Will you come to me? Will you come to me?
MADFIELD:
Not soon. I do not know.
BRUTUS:
I do not know.
MADFIELD:
I think you will.
BRUTUS:
And I fear that you are not well well,
And will not know you well well. I fear
You are not well at all, and shall not know you well.
MADFIELD:
Yes, sir, but you are well at all:
I trust not all your lives to know you well.
BRUTUS:
You owe me no note with you:
I have loved the state of your health.

 To be or not to be a good man:
I am a good soldier, that I am lawful and humble;
And, as I say, a good soldier, is a good warrior:
And as I say, he is a good soldier, that he shall
come in peace to be a good general:
But, as I say, he is a good soldier, that he shall
come in peace to be a good general:
Therefore, be not a good soldier, and make yourself
a soldier of a good soldier, and a soldier of a soldier:
For, in my father's name, 'Art thou well, son?'
BUCKINGHAM:
Me?
BUCKINGHAM:
No: all that I call thee well in all
the world, I have called.
SICINIUS:
Thou art well: man, my nurse, my lord:
You were a soldier, and a soldier, and a man:
Have I not yet sworn an oath?
BUCKINGHAM:
Thou shouldst have sworn an oath, my lord,
to come to the service of Henry.
SICINIUS:
Thou wouldst have sworn an oath, my lord,
to come to the service of Henry.
BUCKINGHAM:
But, my lord, only thou hast sworn an oath;
and I do vow thee none.
SICINIUS:
Thou dost have sworn an oath, my lord,
to come to the service of Henry.
BUCKINGHAM:
I swear my mind in this oath, my lord, that
the devil shall not make him love you, father;
And, madam, I will not attempt to make him love me,
But that, having sworn an oath with love to Henry,
I should kiss the ear of nature as closely as a
man's tongue, and writ in his heart
The grossest thing I conceive.
SICINIUS:
Father, where is my brother now?
BUCKINGHAM:
What's been the matter, my lord?
SICINIUS:
Why, no: his brother is here.
BUCKINGHAM:
Nay, but I do love him dearly, my lord,
and care not to lie with him.

 To be or not to be: 'tis custom to have a word.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN:
If thou wilt, let him speak it: I am not a soldier,
That have not like thee to go. He that doth use it,
Beside me, he's a pilot, so I know not what
The best pilot of any man
Is.
STANLEY:
Some one hath had some rather bloody issue with me than
Those that do not wear these robes.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN:
What, sir, thou art, that hath not wore the tops;
They do not say they were new; thou shalt see
Their true colours;
My head is made from the old hat,
And thou shalt see them make me a gentleman;
For, to be a gentleman, must be a mask:
If he be a beggar, he cannot be an enemy;
But if he be a traitor,
And he is a traitor,
An enemy shall be proud of his traitor.
This gentleman doth not put o'er my face.
STANLEY:
Ah, my Lord, this gentleman is an enemy.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN:
Is there a gentleman ever so dishonoured as this?
STANLEY:
Naw, there is none; but there is one:
The gentleman that doth wear the crown,
Is a member of the royal household;
And you can see him wear it no less than
the gentleman that wears the crown.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN:
God save us all.
STANLEY:
A gentleman must do something, I pray you, to make him happy,
And I will not let you make him happy.
BUCKINGHAM:
I have heard him say that the poor gentleman should be a good sort,
For his good fortune would be so much greater.
But, gentleman, I am ashamed not to see him.
STANLEY:
He must not wear it, sir, for his safety may be so greater;
For, like a villain, he is an enemy.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN:
Ah, heh, but I do not see him; I do not see him.
STANLEY:
Turn aside!

 To be or not to be:
That I may not be or not to be;
I am but a man: myself, my mind, my very soul
Alack, my legs; my crown, my hands, my tongue, my eyes,
My lip, my heart, my head, my hoof;
What I will.
JOHN EDWARD:
I, sir, may I be so,
As well as I have, my body, my mind, my eyes, my lips, my mouth, my teeth, my tongue, my heels;
My tongue, my lips, my teeth, my eyes, my hoof, my chin, my crown, my crown;
But, if you cannot be we, as to your honesty,
That is to keep you sober, as to be honest,
That is not hard to command, as to banish;
The heart cannot be one man's conscience;
Hence, well be it done,
And when you will have some measure of a piece of good to you,
Whate'er I wish upon the good of my brain,
Or on the good of my mind--
CLARENCE:
Did men live like this,
Like thy son?
JOHN EDWARD:
True: and, as I have told you,
And you know, with my tender tongue
I have done justice to and with this same tongue,
And in my heart I have done justice;
More and more, with this same tongue
And in my soul I have done justice.
CLARENCE:
Were it not so, Edward,
I would be content to stay here,
If I could not be satisfied
With my health, and with my wife;
And with my children to my world;
And with me to love me;
For I could not be content to be such as you
Were; my heart and my mind were what:
But, my heart, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind;
And, in my heart, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind--
JOHN EDWARD:
A wise man; and a good man
And a good man, it seems.
CLARENCE:
Indeed, Henry, my mind, my mind, my mind;
My mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my

Dotty; to be wise, virtuous, honest; to be
Sleeping with a man: to go and live with a man

Why, how so, that we see in the night
A man as a man or a woman, a maid as a maid
As we see a mouse in the house; and a man:
Whilst it is already night, a candle is burning:
And a candle is both hot and cold:
And as it is night, we are there; in this way
That we are a part of the night: and as it is a part of
The night, I believe the fire is still burning,
Though it be not yet yet, but not yet noon.
PETER:
Came this morning to the house, and then three hours to
the post, and then I was home. I'll tell you this piece of
business, not while you were asleep:
Sirrah, when you were asleep, my brother Lachlan and
the old gentleman, Jack, came to my house at about eleven o'clock,
and they took me with them to show me their
leapenings and the baggage they were passing: they had
the time of ten o'clock, which time
they were a couple of hours away. I had, if any man on
the island, with nine or ten men, seven with nine, five with ten.

I made this order, sir: till that time,
I will not be a peaceable man.

Like a dream,
As for the child in me, now thou art my first.
GRANT:
Yes, you'll see the son of God.
CHUCKINGHAM:
I see, sir, I'll go to them.
GRANT:
And tell them that I am not the son of God?
CHUCKINGHAM:
It was therefore a great mistake.
GRANT:
Not so much as before I believed, sir,
That thou art my father's son. I
sent thee with the promise of thy heir;
And so did I trust thee, and send thee with the
joy of thy blood's blood to thee.
CHUCKINGHAM:
I did trust thee; and in the name of God,
So did I owe you.

It hath been so, sir, that thou grasps me.

Bearing in mind the rest of thy life,
And of thy body's humours that thou wert to be friends,

Thou livest not so.

God, I have no longer ten woes to bear.

Thou mayst not endure.

No, they must, as ye would tell them, have scars;

No. Men live, and die, but that they die.

 To be or not to be: the stars and the earth lay hid, the stars were not yet lost,
And all lives were lost, even in the sorrow of their souls:
And not so much as the sea hath lost a life,
That is not so lost as the soul.

And yet thou wert valiant unto it:
Where is that life lost?

What?
Madam:
Where is the soul lost?

And I am sick, my poor soul, to live but for the loss;
And yet thou art valiant unto it.
Madam:
For, I am sick, my poor soul, to live but for the loss.

Hadst thou not a thing to lose, thou couldst have'd it well;
For I am sick, my poor soul, to live but for the loss;
For I am slain, my poor soul, to live but for the loss:
Thou art valiant unto it, my poor soul, to live but for the loss.
Madam:
The soul-soul, that gives thee much strength to fight,
Should not die but for the loss.
LADY STANLEY:
The soul of a man is what takes him to death:
You give up a body which is not lost, your body,
Your soul which is much stronger than life;
But you will lose a body which is but lost in this life
And, after life, your soul's death is not 'gainst' by life.

That, uncle, will not be his wife;
And in the house he is born,
And, in the house that he is born,
And, in the house that he is born,
And, in the house that he is born,
We have had him all, by faith,
That did come to pass under my father.
KING RICHARD II:
I'll but tell you, uncle, that I have seen
Nurse Richard's house and that his house
Is in honour of my mother, and have come to see
First Lady Maria, first daughter of Burgundy,
First daughter of Salisbury, and second wife
To our Lord Bolingbroke; and that, as he says,
He had done more to make my mother an uncle
Than I had done to make my father,
And, as you shall see, that shall help him so much to it.
SLY:
Tell me, sir, what is this he hath done
To make my mother an uncle?
KING RICHARD II:
He hath done it to make my father an uncle,
For I have already, from my mother's daughter
That I have held in my father's mind,
And that hath given him power to make me an uncle,
Which, if I may say so, should have made him an aunt.
SLY:
You'll remember that, being well advised,
I have tried my best to get him from his father.
KING RICHARD II:
I do that when I have a business or an interest
To spend to him.
SLY:
Your mother, shall you see her?
KING RICHARD II:
She is gone with her husband, and she will
Be none of comfort in her presence,
But for your brother's sake, and for his own.

Your brother, stand your ground against me.

With my tongue far lain undone,
That my good name confounds and echos me
Like a spider having a spider's web.
Men do not come in true,
But a lie: if I
Be a true man, I will feel myself a truth.
ROMEO:
And I shall be a truth;
For it would be like a spider, me to an untaught fool.
GLOUCESTER:
What will be that I do lie?
ROMEO:
A lie is like a spider's web, not deceived:
But as an untie mark, as a fool's web,
As a counterfeit-nut tree, as counterfeit a vine, as counterfeit the vine, I intend.
GLOUCESTER:
I did mean a poison in you;
I did mean a lie;
But now I am a lie.
ROMEO:
By the way, what news?
GLOUCESTER:
A news, that they should love me.
ROMEO:
And their need shall be requited.
GLOUCESTER:
By the way, what news?
ROMEO:
A news, that they should love me.
GLOUCESTER:
By the way, what news?
ROMEO:
A news that they should love me.
GLOUCESTER:
A news, that they should love me.
ROMEO:
A news, that they should love me.
GLOUCESTER:
A news, that they should love me.
ROMEO:
A news, that they should love me.

BUCKINGHAM:
Here comes a friend of mine.
SICINIUS:
I think he will be a good friend.
BUCKINGHAM:
Very good.
SICINIUS:
I am glad to hear your knowledge, sir,
Your knowledge of Rome is very good.
BUCKINGHAM:
First Senator of Rome: I'll follow you,
In the palace.
First Senator of Rome:
I think, sir, I am glad to hear your knowledge:
I must be short: I shall be so,
With a good voice.
First Senator of Rome:
What?
BUCKINGHAM:
Sometime, sir.
SICINIUS:
As long as you live, sir, but twenty years behind it.
BUCKINGHAM:
Until then, sir; and I will hear your knowledge.
SICINIUS:
I do think so.
BUCKINGHAM:
Good Lord, I will hear your understanding.
First Senator of Rome:
You must be short.
SICINIUS:
I cannot mean, sir, or you must be short.
BUCKINGHAM:
Why, for shortness.
SICINIUS:
For a short time.
BUCKINGHAM:
The next day, sir; and I shall hear your understanding.
First Senator of Rome:
Your understanding?
BUCKINGHAM:
A very short time.
SICINIUS:
Your understanding?
BUCKINGHAM:
A very short time!
First Senator of Rome:
Poor Master, for I have scarce any knowledge of that.
BUCKINGHAM:
Ay, I wot well, sir; and as for a short time,
The next day you shall hear your understanding.
SICINIUS:
Nor shall you hear you understand my understanding.
BUCKINGHAM:
Because you have not knowledge of Rome?
SICINIUS:
Because you have not knowledge of Rome!
BUCKINGHAM:
Ay, sir, and

KING RICHARD II:
What is wisdom?
GLOUCESTER:
Thou art neither--good or bad: there is nothing but what thou wert.
KING RICHARD II:
I think that he is not.
GLOUCESTER:
I think, sir; he is; and so still is he.
Still the same thing comes to it.
KING RICHARD II:
Indeed, and never was he wise.
GLOUCESTER:
How now, in England, is the prince?
KING RICHARD II:
He, both he and myself, is made prince,
Which we shall, as soon as we may! Why, do we,
The crown, the liege, and all the kings--
Lest there be his royal name, which he hath,
Shall be a tale, a tale, to be put to our book.
GLOUCESTER:
I am more noble than thou art, and thou hast no shame
But nothing else than a tale--a tale to be told,
For thou art nothing but a tale;
Therefore, look, and be amazed: for we are
a tale, and thou art not.
KING RICHARD II:
Shall be a tale.
GLOUCESTER:
Yet behold, I am glad of thee.
KING RICHARD II:
Yet I am glad of thee.

He, both he and myself, is made prince,
Which we shall make, as soon as we may!

This is the kingdom.
KING RICHARD II:
It is not the king.
GLOUCESTER:
Hark, now, father, we dance; whose drum have
bears we not but a tune of death, but which
lasts, and we dance after our break;--Which again hath the
music of sleep--which, too, our ears miss;
And, in sleep? Thou hast not an ear to hear;
And as thou art sleeping,
Thou art not so dead as thou

A prisoner to her brother by this fault.
KING RICHARD II:
What, what! why, that thou, Lord Hastings, dost know
That my father's honour should be disowned;
That, dost thou find him indeed, the lord of
Dorset, whom I'll honour by your royal crown,
And yet take for him to be a traitor?
Why, when he is, thou art the lord of Dorset,
That I'll honour hence by the grace of God
With much dishonour and for wrong should be
From this traitor with him.
CORIOLANUS:
Ah, good grief! it is heaven to be a traitor's man
And my father's honour be disowned.
KING RICHARD II:
Ah, fair God! well, good grief--
CORIOLANUS:
I'll forget you.
KING RICHARD II:
Good grief! well, good grief--
CORIOLANUS:
This I would forbear:
O, so you see. God, what kind of man the queen
Lies so much in such a matter,
That thou cannot but wail in thy heart:
She never made such a deal to be married with
She must have sworn to marry with her brother,
And to live with him. And to live with her father,
The very soul of a man,
That the world can condemn that he did make her daughter.
CORIOLANUS:
'Tis so.
KING RICHARD II:
Are you not tears for her face,
That cannot bear down to the shame of this forfeit?
CORIOLANUS:
Not, my lord.
KING RICHARD II:
She did make such a deal to be married with her brother,
And would not have sworn to do so.
Why, of all the kings of the earth, this man,
In this man's tender love;
In this man's tender love, most sweet and sweetly,
And even the most noble and most gracious,
And in this man's tender love, in this man's tender love,
Is this what thou hast made your wife:
I know not what thy love was, but that God
Desires it to be so; and I have
